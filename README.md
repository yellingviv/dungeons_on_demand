This will eventually be a far more useful README but right now it's just some notes.

Working on creating a dungeon generator for D&D 5e that will create dungeons on demand, based on the level indicated by the DM in the request form, as well as the number of monsters and the size of the room. It will track initiative for both the party and the monsters, as well as stats for the monsters. It will provide data about who has done the most damage, had the most kills, etc, because D&D players are jerks who want to be the best, so let's quantify that. :D

Right now I'm still in testing and development, so ignore *literally everything* in this repo.

Test data generated at mockaroo: https://mockaroo.com/

Multiple candidates for D&D 5e APIs for monster data, so watch this space for updates on that.
