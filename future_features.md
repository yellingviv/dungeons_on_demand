Dungeons On Demand - Future features

I have a long list of future features, and a few of just basic improvements:

1) The "start combat" button is disabled until at least one monster and at least one character has been instantiated
2) on the monsters only view, the damage, roll initiative, roll to hit, etc, buttons won't be there
3) likewise on the players only view
4) god that login flow, ugh
