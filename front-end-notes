make a master "game container"

game container can hold containers for all other items such as mosnters, players, initiative, stats, etc

then the master container can pass down state to each of those containers so that we can toggle between them with a button press that will indicate which should have the state of visible at a given time

they will hold their other state in the background and can just come forward to be visible as called

class MonsterContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
}

class GameContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    this.setState;
    this.State = { active = Monster };
  }
  render() {
    if this.state.active === 'Monster' {
      <MonsterContainer />
    }
    <PlayerContainer />
  }
}


pull monster data from API in parent container and then pass it down to the monster container as a prop so that I don't have to worry about multiple API calls unless specifically prompted and all that happens in the monster container is the rendering
