Initial placeholder.

Divs that will be needed:

- index page:
--- not logged in
--- log in flow

- logged in game and room selection spread
--- a div for each game, with room sub-divs inside
--- div to create new game, sub-divs in games for new room

- new game flow - dialog boxes? layer? something like that?
--- name the game
--- add character information by character, prompt for another character or no
--- return to selection spread to create room

- new room flow
--- name the room
--- indicate number of monsters and level
--- pushes to room screen

- room screen
--- player info on left
------ each player name is a div that opens out to show detail when clicked on
--- tabs to return to home, look at stats, be in room on far left
--- room squares in the middle
--- monster info on the left side
------ also open out to show detail on click, like PCs
--- initiative list above the monster list
------ initiative list is sub divs for each PC and NPC
------ there is a colored overlay that lights up the div background for turn
------ colored overlay on monsters when they are killed (or PCs, I guess)
--- monster dots on squares that can be moved

- player stat screen
--- bars for each player of total damage dealt
--- bars for each player of total killing blows
--- bars for each player of damage per room
--- bars for each player of kills per room
